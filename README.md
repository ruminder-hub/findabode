## Search and Search Results
The search page shows a search bar allowing users to search for a place using any keyword. Below the search bar, the list of most explored places is displayed. The most explored places show the list of places that are highly rated and explored by other users based on the services they were offered. This allows the end-users to save time from searching and then finding the right choice.
